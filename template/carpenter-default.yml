  # The version of the pipeline. Used to accomodate rolling breaking changes across multiple pipelines.
  # A breaking change could implement new functionality under an incremented version number, and move
  # dependent pipelines over separately. Defaults to pipelineVersion 1. To ensure that future changes
  # to the pipeline do not break build which extend this template, it is recommended that this parameter
  # is passed to the template.
