# Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Carpenter supports Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 to better define how version numbers are assigned and incremented. More information about SemVer can be found at [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/).

## Enabling SemVer versioning

To enable SemVer versioning, add the following parameter to your yaml.

```
stages:
- template: template/carpenter-default.yml
  parameters:
    buildVersionType: semver
```

## The `VERSION` file

The version file is used to populate the build version.

By default, VERSION in the root of the source path is used.

## Build Labels

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration builds adds datecode and revision to the version label.

For example:

0.2.0-CI.20220122.1
