# Note: This build uses the pipeline templates directly to avoid getting into a
# state where the deployed pipeline does not work and a fix cannot be deployed.

# Default name for the build, prior to build versioning
# $(Build.BuildId) is the default value used when YAML cannot be parsed
name: $(Build.BuildId)

# Use pipeline template
stages:
- template: template/carpenter-default.yml
  parameters:
    # The version of the pipeline. Used to accomodate rolling breaking changes across multiple pipelines.
    # A breaking change could implement new functionality under an incremented version number, and move
    # dependent pipelines over separately. Defaults to pipelineVersion 1. To ensure that future changes
    # to the pipeline do not break build which extend this template, it is recommended that this parameter
    # is passed to the template.
