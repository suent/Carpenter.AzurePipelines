stages:
- template: template/carpenter-default.yml
  parameters:
    # The version of the pipeline. Used to accomodate rolling breaking changes across multiple pipelines.
    # A breaking change could implement new functionality under an incremented version number, and move

    # to the pipeline do not break build which extend this template, it is recommended that this parameter
    # is passed to the template.
