# Build Versioning

Carpenter allows for versioning to be applied to builds and releases in a consistent manner.

## Build Revision

The build revision tracks the number of builds for a particular project.

For more information, see [build-revision.md](build-versioning/build-revision.md).

## Version Type

The `pipelineOperations` parameter determines which type of versioning is used. More information can be found below.

## Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

Carpenter supports Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. 

For more information, see [semantic-versioning.md](build-versioning/semantic-versioning.md).
