# Carpenter.AzurePipelines Variables

## Pipeline variables

### Carpenter.PipelineVersion

The version of the pipeline. Used to accomodate rolling breaking changes across multiple pipelines.
A breaking change could implement new functionality under an incremented version number, and move
dependent pipelines over separately. This value is populated through the pipelineVersion parameter.
Defaults to 1. 

More info: [pipeline-versioning.md](pipeline-versioning.md)

### Carpenter.Pipeline

If true, the pipeline will be included in the sources directory. When directly linking the pipeline
template through a repository resource, includePipeline must be true to download the Carpenter
scripts and tools to be available to the pipeline. Defaults to true.

### Carpenter.Pipeline.Path

The path to the pipeline supporting files. This value is determined during the pipeline execution.

### Carpenter.Pipeline.ScriptPath

The path to Carpenter pipeline scripts. This value is determined during the pipeline execution.

### Carpenter.DotNet.Path

The path to .NET binaries. This value is determined during the pipeline execution. If the .NET
binaries do not exist, they will be downloaded to this path.

### Carpenter.Build.Type

The type of build being executed. This value gets set automatically during an automated build.
If a manual build, the value of the buildType parameter is used.
